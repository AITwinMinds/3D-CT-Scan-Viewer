## Required Libraries

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy nibabel PyQt5 matplotlib
```

## How to Use

Here is the updated README to clarify both methods of naming the folders and files:

### Prepare Directories

Ensure the following directories exist in the project root:
- `CT`
- `Ground_truth`
- `Predicted`

If they do not exist, the script will create them automatically.

### Naming Conventions

You can name your files using one of the following two methods:

1. **Numeric Only IDs:**

   - **CT scans:** Place files in the `CT` directory. Name them as `<subject_id>.nii.gz`.

     Example:
     ```
     CT/
     ├── 001.nii.gz
     ├── 002.nii.gz
     └── 003.nii.gz
     ```

   - **Ground truth segmentations:** Place files in the `Ground_truth` directory. Name them as `<subject_id>.nii.gz`.

     Example:
     ```
     Ground_truth/
     ├── 001.nii.gz
     ├── 002.nii.gz
     └── 003.nii.gz
     ```

   - **Predicted segmentations:** Place files in the `Predicted` directory. Name them as `<subject_id>.nii.gz`.

     Example:
     ```
     Predicted/
     ├── 001.nii.gz
     ├── 002.nii.gz
     └── 003.nii.gz
     ```

2. **Alphanumeric IDs:**

   - **CT scans:** Place files in the `CT` directory. Name them as `<subject_id>.nii.gz`.

     Example:
     ```
     CT/
     ├── SUB_001.nii.gz
     ├── SUB_002.nii.gz
     └── SUB_003.nii.gz
     ```

   - **Ground truth segmentations:** Place files in the `Ground_truth` directory. Name them as `<subject_id>.nii.gz`.

     Example:
     ```
     Ground_truth/
     ├── SUB_001.nii.gz
     ├── SUB_002.nii.gz
     └── SUB_003.nii.gz
     ```

   - **Predicted segmentations:** Place files in the `Predicted` directory. Name them as `<subject_id>.nii.gz`.

     Example:
     ```
     Predicted/
     ├── SUB_001.nii.gz
     ├── SUB_002.nii.gz
     └── SUB_003.nii.gz
     ```

Execute the script to start the GUI:

```bash
python viewer.py
```

### Using the GUI

- Use the left `<` and right `>` arrow buttons to navigate through different subjects. You can use either numeric or alphanumeric IDs for the subjects (e.g., 001, SUB_001).
- Enter the subject ID directly in the input field to load a specific subject.
- View Controls: Switch between axial, coronal, and sagittal views.
- Toggle contour display and adjust contour line width.
- Adjust colors for labels and opacity of overlays.
- Adjust the slider to navigate through slices.
- Change the minimum and maximum intensity values to adjust the CT scan contrast.
- Use the `▶` button to animate through the slices automatically.
- Toggle the overlay of ground truth and predicted segmentation masks using the `Toggle Overlay` button.
